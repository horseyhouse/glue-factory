            The Glue Factory is a DIY venue in Somerville, MA. We host punk,
            indie, raves, drag, or whatever we feel like. Respect the space.

            Somerville is a dense residential area and you and your invitees
            must be respectful of our neighbors. We only book shows on weekends
            and shows must end promptly at 10pm.

            <strong>DO NOT POST THE ADDRESS PUBLICLY</strong>. Use "ask a horse"
            or "ask a punk" on flyers. Only give the address to people you trust
            on a need-to-know basis.
